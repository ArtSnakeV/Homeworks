                <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>
                <p>Iron Man's powered armor suit has many weapons and other technological devices that originally appeared in the comics, including: repulsor rays that shoot from the palms of his gauntlets; a uni-beam projector in his chest; and miniature versions of most of the weapons the armor carries, including a flamethrower, and a radioâ€”a "hotline" corresponding to the red phone on Batman's utility belt. The suit is powered by a compact fusion reactor.</p>
